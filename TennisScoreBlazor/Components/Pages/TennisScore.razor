<PageTitle>TennisScore Calculator!</PageTitle>
@* NOTES:  *@
@* I am well aware of using <br> is non-semantic and should be done in css, but in this app i mainly focused on code, and not styling. Same goes for <strong> and <hr>  *@
@* I simply chose to build the html fairly quickly and kept it simple, not to spend too much time on this part. *@
@* If you want me to do redo this part correctly, just give me a heads up and i will fix it!*@
@* Hope this meets your requirements! :)
